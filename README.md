# Long Live the Empire: A C2 Workshop for Modern Red Teaming

## Workshop Purpose
This comprehensive workshop aims to equip participants with an in-depth understanding of modern Command and Control (C2) concepts, focusing on the open-source Empire C2 framework. Attendees will learn how to deploy and leverage the Empire framework for executing advanced attack scenarios, thereby sharpening their skills as red team operators.

## Abstract
Command and Control (C2) is a critical aspect of modern Red Teams and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), facilitating persistent connections to target networks and control expansion within the infrastructure. Participants will delve into a range of topics, including the setup of Empire, understanding listeners, stagers, agents, and exploring Empire's modules and evasion techniques. The learning journey involves hands-on exercises, guiding the attendees in configuring and deploying Empire servers, client interactions, and implementation of various listeners and modules. The workshop culminates in a mini Capture-The-Flag (CTF) challenge, enabling participants to apply their learned knowledge in a cloud-hosted environment provided by Immersive Labs.
